cgmodsel - a Python3 package to estimate conditional Gaussian (CG) distributions from data

Version 1.0, 5.3.2020

### Content ###

This package contains solvers (mostly ADMM-based) for estimating various types of CG models (sparse pairwise, sparse + low-rank pairwise, mean parameters).
Please see the [Wiki](https://github.com/franknu/cgmodsel/wiki) for additional information.

### Setup cgmodsel ###

For normal usage:

1. Clone this repository into a folder of your choice. 
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the chosen directory using cd.
3. Install the `cgmodsel` package locally by typing `pip install .`

You can also use the code without doing the third step from inside the folder. For a quick start, execute the file `quick_cgmod.py` from the main folder.
